# 🌪️ Catastrophe Risk Modeling & Loss Estimation
*Reinsurance | Python | SQL | Monte Carlo Simulation | Actuarial Science*

---

## 📋 Business Problem
Reinsurance companies must quantify catastrophe exposure before pricing treaties. This project builds a complete CAT risk model using actuarial frequency-severity methodology and Monte Carlo simulation.

---

## 🎯 Key Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Monte Carlo Simulations | 10,000 iterations |
| Frequency Model | Poisson distribution (KS-test validated) |
| Severity Model | Log-Normal distribution |
| Risk Metrics | EAL, VaR 95%, VaR 99%, VaR 99.5% (Solvency II) |
| Treaty Structures Analysed | 3 XL layers compared |
| Countries Covered | 20 countries, 1970–2014 |

## 🔧 Methodology

1. **Synthetic Dataset** — Built from real EM-DAT/NatCat anchors (Katrina $200B, Tohoku $235B, Haiti 220K deaths)
2. **SQL Analysis** — Risk tiering by country, decade trend analysis, top-10 deadliest countries
3. **Frequency Model** — Poisson distribution fitted to annual event counts
4. **Severity Model** — Log-Normal distribution fitted to loss magnitudes
5. **Monte Carlo** — 10,000 simulations of annual aggregate loss
6. **OEP Curve** — Occurrence Exceedance Probability for treaty pricing
7. **XL Treaty Analysis** — 3 reinsurance structures compared for risk transfer efficiency

## 💡 Key Insights

- Losses increasing decade-over-decade → premiums need trend loading
- Top 10 countries = 80%+ of global catastrophe mortality
- 1-in-100 year loss ≈ **4–5× the Expected Annual Loss** — heavy tail confirmed
- Solvency II capital (99.5th percentile) materially exceeds VaR 99%
- Higher retention structures transfer significantly less tail risk

## 🗂️ Dataset
**Source:** Synthetic dataset anchored to published EM-DAT and Munich Re NatCat records  
**Real events included:** Bhola Cyclone, Tangshan, Katrina, Sichuan, Haiti, Tohoku, Haiyan  
**Architecture:** Identical to real HDX data — model is fully transferable
